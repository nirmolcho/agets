UX/UI Improvement Guidelines for Agent Orchestration Studio
1. Visual Hierarchy & Layout

Clarify hierarchy: CEO → Departments → Managers → Agents should be instantly scannable. Use consistent spacing, indentation, and line weight for solid vs. dashed connections.

Card density: Reduce text clutter on agent cards. Show role + status + department tag at a glance; move extended details into the side panel.

Zoom & pan cues: Provide subtle grid/guide backgrounds to help orientation during navigation.

2. Theming & Aesthetics

Dark theme polish: Ensure consistent contrast ratios (WCAG 3.0 minimum 4.5:1 for text).

Gradients: Restrict to department tags only, as planned—avoid gradients on buttons or icons for readability.

Typography: Apply a clear hierarchy (e.g., department names in medium weight, agent roles in regular).

3. Interaction & Feedback

Status indicators: Use color + icon (not color alone) for active/idle/error. Add subtle animations (pulse, blink) for real-time feel.

Microinteractions: On hover, highlight card edges and show quick actions (Start/Stop/Error).

Reorganize action: Animate the transition so users keep spatial context.

4. Task Panel (Right Side)

Task prioritization: Use chips or color-coded tags for priority.

Sorting: Let users toggle sort order (by due date, priority, status) with clear affordances.

Compact layout: Collapse long task lists; expand on click.

5. Department Overlay

Consistency: Match card styling with main view but simplify (tile grid).

Focus mode: When opening a department, dim the background org view to reduce distraction.

6. Content & UX Writing

Apply content heuristics:

Use plain language for statuses, actions, and errors (e.g., “Paused” instead of “Idle”).

Keep button labels concise (“Add Agent”, “Export JSON”).

Ensure consistency across panels and overlays (avoid mixing synonyms like “Dept” and “Department”).

7. Accessibility

Keyboard navigation: Ensure tab order through cards, overlays, and panels.

Screen reader support: Each card should announce agent name, role, department, and status.

Color + icon for status (don’t rely on color alone).

8. System Design Approach

Treat every card, overlay, and panel as part of a design system.

Define tokens for:

Colors (status states, background, overlays)

Typography (titles, body, tags)

Spacing (card padding, line height, grid)

Icons (status, department)

✅ Summary for your agents:
“Make the org chart easier to scan, agent cards lighter, status more intuitive, overlays consistent, and tasks panel more functional. Apply a cohesive design system (colors, spacing, typography), follow accessibility best practices, and keep all copy clear and consistent.”
