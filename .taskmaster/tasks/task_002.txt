# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Visual Hierarchy for Organization Chart
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the visual hierarchy to make CEO → Departments → Managers → Agents instantly scannable.
# Details:
Modify the organization chart layout to:
- Use consistent spacing between hierarchy levels
- Apply proper indentation for subordinate elements
- Differentiate line weights for solid vs. dashed connections
- Implement subtle grid/guide backgrounds to help with orientation during navigation
- Ensure proper alignment of elements at each hierarchy level

CSS implementation should include:
```css
.org-chart {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: var(--spacing-md);
}

.hierarchy-level-1 { margin-left: 0; }
.hierarchy-level-2 { margin-left: var(--spacing-lg); }
/* Continue for additional levels */

.connection-line-solid {
  border-width: 2px;
  border-style: solid;
}

.connection-line-dashed {
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: dashed;
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test the visual hierarchy with different organizational structures to ensure it scales appropriately. Conduct user testing to verify that the hierarchy is instantly scannable. Verify proper rendering across different screen sizes and zoom levels.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement CSS Grid Layout for Organization Chart [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the base grid layout for the organization chart with proper spacing and responsive behavior.
### Details:
Create the foundational CSS grid layout for the organization chart. Implement the .org-chart class with grid properties that allow for responsive behavior. Set up appropriate gap variables for consistent spacing between elements. Ensure the grid adapts to different screen sizes using minmax and auto-fit properties.

## 2. Implement Hierarchy Level Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create CSS classes for different hierarchy levels with proper indentation and visual differentiation.
### Details:
Implement CSS classes for each hierarchy level (.hierarchy-level-1, .hierarchy-level-2, etc.) with appropriate margin-left values to create proper indentation. Use CSS custom properties (variables) for spacing to maintain consistency. Ensure each level is visually distinct while maintaining a cohesive look. Apply additional styling such as font-weight or size variations to further emphasize the hierarchy.

## 3. Implement Connection Line Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create styles for solid and dashed connection lines with appropriate weights to visually represent relationships.
### Details:
Implement the .connection-line-solid and .connection-line-dashed classes with appropriate border-width and border-style properties. Use thicker lines (2px) for solid connections to represent direct relationships and thinner lines (1px) for dashed connections to represent indirect relationships. Add appropriate colors that work in both light and dark themes. Ensure lines connect elements properly with correct positioning.

## 4. Implement Grid/Guide Background [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add subtle background grid or guides to help with orientation during navigation of the organization chart.
### Details:
Create a subtle grid or guide background using CSS. This can be implemented using background-image with linear-gradient to create light grid lines, or by adding subtle borders to container elements. Ensure the grid is visible enough to provide orientation but not so prominent that it distracts from the content. Make the grid responsive to maintain consistent appearance across different screen sizes.

## 5. Implement Element Alignment and Spacing Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Ensure proper alignment of elements at each hierarchy level and consistent spacing throughout the organization chart.
### Details:
Review and refine the alignment of all elements within the organization chart. Implement consistent vertical and horizontal alignment for elements at the same hierarchy level. Use CSS Flexbox within grid cells if needed for precise alignment. Ensure consistent spacing between elements both horizontally and vertically. Create helper classes for alignment if necessary. Verify that all elements maintain proper alignment when the chart is resized or when content varies in length.
