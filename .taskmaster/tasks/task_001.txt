# Task ID: 1
# Title: Establish Design System Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive design system implementation based on the existing design.json file, ensuring compliance with PRD specifications for colors, typography, spacing, and icons.
# Details:
Implement the design system in code using the existing design tokens from design.json without modifying the file:
- Colors: Use the existing color palette for status states (active/idle/error), backgrounds, overlays, and department tags
- Typography: Implement the defined hierarchy for titles, body text, and tags with appropriate weights (medium for department names, regular for agent roles)
- Spacing: Apply standardized card padding, line height, and grid spacing from design.json
- Icons: Implement the existing icon set for status indicators and departments

Ensure all color implementations meet WCAG 3.0 minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text. Create developer-friendly documentation that explains how to use the design system in the project.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the design system implementation by creating sample components with the defined tokens. Verify contrast ratios using accessibility tools. Review with stakeholders to ensure alignment with brand guidelines and PRD requirements. Test the implementation across different browsers and devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Existing design.json File [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and document the structure and contents of the existing design.json file to understand available tokens and how they should be implemented.
### Details:
1. Locate and analyze the existing design.json file
2. Document the color tokens available for status states, backgrounds, overlays, and department tags
3. Identify typography definitions including font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
4. Map out spacing tokens and their intended usage
5. Catalog available icons and their naming conventions
6. Create a reference document showing the complete token structure
7. Identify any potential gaps between design.json and PRD requirements

## 2. Implement Color System from design.json [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a code implementation of the color system based on the existing tokens in design.json that meets WCAG 3.0 accessibility standards.
### Details:
1. Create a theme.js or styles.css file to implement color tokens from design.json
2. Map color tokens for status states (active, idle, error) to CSS variables or theme properties
3. Implement background colors for cards, panels, and main content areas
4. Set up overlay colors with appropriate opacity levels
5. Implement department tag colors as defined in design.json
6. Test all color combinations against WCAG 3.0 standards (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio)
7. Document how developers should use the color system in their components

## 3. Implement Typography System from design.json [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a code implementation of the typography system based on the existing tokens in design.json.
### Details:
1. Implement font families from design.json in CSS or theme configuration
2. Create CSS classes or styled components for the font size scale (h1, h2, h3, body, caption)
3. Apply font weights as specified in design.json (medium for department names, regular for agent roles)
4. Implement line heights for optimal readability
5. Set up letter spacing based on design.json specifications
6. Create utility classes or mixins for common text styles
7. Document how developers should use the typography system in their components

## 4. Implement Spacing and Layout System from design.json [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a code implementation of the spacing system based on the existing tokens in design.json.
### Details:
1. Implement spacing scale from design.json as CSS variables or theme properties
2. Create utility classes for standard spacing values (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
3. Implement card padding standards based on design.json specifications
4. Set up grid spacing and gutters for layout consistency
5. Apply line height values that work with the typography system
6. Create mixins or utility functions for common spacing patterns
7. Document how developers should use the spacing system in their layouts

## 5. Implement Icon System from design.json [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a code implementation of the icon system based on the existing icons defined in design.json.
### Details:
1. Create an icon component that uses the icons defined in design.json
2. Implement status indicator icons (active, idle, error)
3. Set up department-specific icons as defined in design.json
4. Ensure consistent sizing, stroke width, and corner radius for all icons
5. Implement icons to work well in both light and dark themes
6. Create an icon library or component that developers can easily import
7. Document icon usage guidelines and naming conventions

## 6. Create Developer Documentation for Design System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the implemented design system in the project.
### Details:
1. Create a design system documentation with examples of all implemented tokens
2. Document how to use color tokens in components
3. Provide examples of typography usage in different contexts
4. Create spacing and layout usage guidelines with code examples
5. Document the icon component API and usage patterns
6. Include code snippets showing proper implementation of each system
7. Create a simple storybook or example page showcasing the design system in action
