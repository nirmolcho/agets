# Task ID: 1
# Title: Establish Design System Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive design system with tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and icons as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Define and implement the following design tokens:
- Colors: Create a palette for status states (active/idle/error), backgrounds, overlays, and department tags
- Typography: Define hierarchy for titles, body text, and tags with appropriate weights (medium for department names, regular for agent roles)
- Spacing: Standardize card padding, line height, and grid spacing
- Icons: Design or select a consistent icon set for status indicators and departments

Ensure all color choices meet WCAG 3.0 minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text. Document the design system in a way that can be referenced by all developers working on the project.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the design system by creating sample components with the defined tokens. Verify contrast ratios using accessibility tools. Review with stakeholders to ensure alignment with brand guidelines and PRD requirements.
