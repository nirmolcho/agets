# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Dark Theme with Proper Contrast
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Polish the dark theme to ensure consistent contrast ratios that meet WCAG 3.0 standards (minimum 4.5:1 for text).
# Details:
Implement a refined dark theme that:
- Uses appropriate background colors that reduce eye strain
- Ensures text elements maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Applies consistent color usage across all components
- Avoids pure black (#000) in favor of dark grays for better readability
- Properly handles borders and dividers in dark mode

CSS implementation:
```css
:root {
  --dark-bg-primary: #121212;
  --dark-bg-secondary: #1e1e1e;
  --dark-text-primary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);
  --dark-text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
  --dark-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12);
}

.dark-theme {
  background-color: var(--dark-bg-primary);
  color: var(--dark-text-primary);
}

.dark-theme .card {
  background-color: var(--dark-bg-secondary);
  border: 1px solid var(--dark-border);
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Use contrast checking tools to verify all text meets WCAG 3.0 standards. Test the theme across different screen brightness levels and environments. Conduct user testing to ensure readability and comfort for extended use periods.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Refine Dark Theme Color Palette [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the current dark theme color palette and refine it to ensure all colors meet WCAG 3.0 contrast standards while maintaining visual appeal and reducing eye strain.
### Details:
Use color contrast analysis tools to evaluate the current palette. Refine the CSS variables for dark theme, focusing on background colors, text colors, and accent colors. Create a comprehensive color palette that avoids pure black (#000) in favor of dark grays. Document the contrast ratios for each text/background combination to ensure they meet the 4.5:1 minimum requirement.

## 2. Implement Core Dark Theme CSS Variables and Base Styles [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive set of CSS variables for the dark theme and implement the base styles that will be applied globally when dark mode is active.
### Details:
Expand the current CSS implementation to include a complete set of dark theme variables. Include variables for primary and secondary backgrounds, text colors at different hierarchy levels, border colors, focus states, and interactive element states. Implement the .dark-theme class that applies these variables to the root elements. Ensure smooth transitions between light and dark themes.

## 3. Apply Dark Theme to Component-Specific Elements [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Extend the dark theme implementation to handle specific UI components that may require custom styling beyond the base theme variables.
### Details:
Identify UI components that need special handling in dark mode (cards, buttons, form elements, modals, tooltips, etc.). Create component-specific dark theme styles that maintain visual consistency while ensuring proper contrast. Pay special attention to borders, shadows, and dividers to ensure they're visible but not harsh in dark mode. Update the CSS to handle these component-specific cases.

## 4. Implement Theme Toggle Functionality with Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create a user-friendly theme toggle mechanism that allows users to switch between light and dark themes, with the selection persisted across sessions.
### Details:
Implement a toggle component that switches between light and dark themes. Use localStorage or similar mechanism to persist the user's theme preference. Ensure the theme is applied immediately upon page load to prevent flash of incorrect theme. Add logic to respect the user's system preference (prefers-color-scheme media query) for the initial theme if no saved preference exists.

## 5. Conduct Comprehensive Accessibility Testing and Refinement [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Perform thorough testing of the dark theme implementation across the entire application to identify and fix any contrast or readability issues.
### Details:
Create a testing plan that covers all UI elements and states in dark mode. Use automated accessibility tools to scan for contrast issues. Manually review all interactive elements, form states (focus, error, disabled), and dynamic content. Pay special attention to text on gradients or images. Document and fix any identified issues. Consider edge cases like user-generated content that might have unpredictable colors.
