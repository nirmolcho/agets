# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Animated Transitions for Reorganization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create smooth animations for reorganization actions to help users maintain spatial context during changes.
# Details:
Implement animations that:
- Smoothly transition cards from old to new positions
- Use appropriate easing functions for natural movement
- Keep duration short enough to not impede workflow (300-500ms)
- Include subtle scaling or opacity changes to enhance the effect

Implementation approach:
```javascript
function animateReorganization(elements, newPositions) {
  // Store original positions
  const originalPositions = elements.map(el => {
    const rect = el.getBoundingClientRect();
    return { top: rect.top, left: rect.left };
  });
  
  // Apply new organization structure in DOM
  applyNewOrganization(elements, newPositions);
  
  // For each element, animate from original to new position
  elements.forEach((el, index) => {
    const newRect = el.getBoundingClientRect();
    const deltaX = originalPositions[index].left - newRect.left;
    const deltaY = originalPositions[index].top - newRect.top;
    
    // Set initial position
    el.style.transform = `translate(${deltaX}px, ${deltaY}px)`;
    el.style.transition = 'none';
    
    // Force reflow
    el.offsetHeight;
    
    // Animate to new position
    el.style.transform = '';
    el.style.transition = 'transform 400ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0.2, 1)';
  });
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test animations with various reorganization scenarios to ensure smooth transitions. Verify performance on lower-end devices. Ensure animations respect user preferences for reduced motion.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up animation utility functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create utility functions to handle position tracking and animation setup for reorganized elements
### Details:
Implement a utility module with functions to: 1) Calculate and store original element positions, 2) Determine position deltas after reorganization, and 3) Set up the initial state for animations. Include helper functions for handling getBoundingClientRect() calculations and position data storage. This will serve as the foundation for all animated transitions.

## 2. Implement FLIP animation technique [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Apply the FLIP (First-Last-Invert-Play) animation technique to create performant transitions
### Details:
Implement the core animation function using the FLIP technique: 1) First: Record the initial positions of elements, 2) Last: Apply the new organization structure, 3) Invert: Apply transforms to make elements appear in their original positions, 4) Play: Transition elements to their final positions with appropriate easing. Use requestAnimationFrame for optimal performance and implement the transform and transition properties as shown in the example code.

## 3. Add subtle visual enhancements [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Enhance animations with subtle scaling and opacity changes to improve visual feedback
### Details:
Extend the animation implementation to include subtle visual enhancements: 1) Add a slight scale reduction (0.98) at the beginning of movement, 2) Implement a subtle opacity change (0.9) during transition, 3) Ensure these effects are synchronized with position changes. These enhancements should make the transitions feel more natural and help users track the movement of elements.

## 4. Implement easing functions and timing controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create configurable easing functions and duration controls for natural movement
### Details:
Implement a system for configurable animation parameters: 1) Create a set of easing functions (cubic-bezier presets) optimized for different types of movements, 2) Set up duration controls within the 300-500ms range, 3) Add acceleration/deceleration patterns for natural movement, 4) Implement a configuration object that allows easy adjustment of these parameters. Default to cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0.2, 1) for a natural ease-out effect.

## 5. Add reduced motion support and cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Implement respect for user preferences regarding reduced motion and handle animation cleanup
### Details:
Finalize the animation implementation with accessibility and cleanup: 1) Detect and respect the prefers-reduced-motion media query, providing simplified or no animations when enabled, 2) Implement proper cleanup of animation styles after completion to prevent interference with subsequent interactions, 3) Add event listeners for animation end to trigger any post-animation actions, 4) Handle edge cases like interrupted animations or rapid successive reorganizations. Ensure the system gracefully degrades for users who prefer reduced motion.
